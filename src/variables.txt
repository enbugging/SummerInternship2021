Meaning of each variables:

1. Global variables
number_of_angles: the number of angles
number_of_terms: the number of multiplicities considered.
number_of_data_points: the number of data points
number_of_distinct_angles: the number of angles of distinct types
nbrs_of_central_atom_1: number of neighbors to the first atom
nbrs_of_central_atom_2: number of neighbors to the second atom
main_mult: main multiplicity, defined by the function main_multiplicity

angles_id[]: the id of the angle in classification of different types, 
            i.e. the id representing the type of angle 
multiplicities[]: harmonics to be considered

epsilon_main: error by optimization of principle force constants only
epsilon_0 = 0.001: to avoid division by 0
w_total: as defined in the scheme

angles: vector of vectors representing angle. e.g. angles[i][j] represents 
        angles at i-th line of j-th angle
interaction: vector of vectors representing interaction energy of distant 
        gourps. e.g. interaction[i][j] represents interaction energy at i-th 
        line of j-th angle
pearson_interact_vs_angles: pearson_interact_vs_angles[i][j] is the pearson
        coefficient between (interaction[i]) and (cos(multiplicities[j] * angles[i][_]))
weights: as defined in the scheme
        weights[j][k] = 
        1.0 / (
            abs(pearson_interact_vs_angles[j][k])
            * magnitude_of_interaction[j] 
            + epsilon_0);

energy: energy[i] is the energy at i-th line, representing dihedral energy of
        the whole angle
magnitude_of_interaction: 
        magnitude_of_interaction[i] = max(interaction[i][j] - interaction[i][k])
        for all j, k

angles_id_dict: a dictionary mapping the string characterizing angle type to the id
        of such angles.

log_file: input file stream buffer

2. Local variables

quantum_mechanic_data: url to the data file 

main_force_constants: the vector of size number_of_angles, containing solely force constants
        of main multiplicities, to be feed into first optimization.
set_of_force_constants: the vector of the size number_of_terms * number_of_angles + 1
        representing the parameters feeding to the subobjective functions to be optimized.
        In particular, set_of_force_constants[number_of_terms * i + j] is the force
        constant of j-th multiplicity of i-th angle; except the last element, which
        represents the offset constant.
set_of_force_constants_reduced: the vector of the size 
        number_of_terms * number_of_distinct_angles + 1 representing the parameters 
        feeding to the objective function to be optimized. In particular, 
        set_of_force_constants[number_of_terms * i + j] = 
			set_of_force_constants_reduced[number_of_terms * angles_id[i] + j];
        except the last element, which represents the offset constant. This is to effectively
        enforce the equality of force constants between angles of the same types.
main_mult: index of the main multiplicity in multiplicities[]

trial: number of runs to be executed. Multiple runs are desirable to ensure stability of result.
